# PRAXO-CORE for Rust

PRAXO-CORE is an embeddable, MIT-licensed agent framework. This crate is its native Rust Core: an agent loop with tool registration and dispatch, policy hooks, typed events, memory, checkpoints, context budgets, middleware, JSON Schema validation, and plugin manifest parsing. It runs in-process and does not require a hosted service.

## Quick start

Install the published package:

```bash
cargo add praxo-core@0.8.0
```

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use praxo_core::agent::{Agent, AgentOptions, Session};
use praxo_core::model::{Message, Model, Request, Response};

struct EchoModel;

impl Model for EchoModel {
    fn generate(&self, _request: &Request) -> praxo_core::errors::Result<Response> {
        Ok(Response {
            message: Message::assistant("hello", Vec::new()),
            ..Response::default()
        })
    }
}

let agent = Agent::new(AgentOptions::new(Arc::new(EchoModel)))?;
let result = agent.run(&Session::new("session-1"), "hi")?;
println!("{} {}", result.output, result.steps);
```

## Examples

Runnable examples live under [`language/rust/examples`](language/rust/examples).

| Example | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| [checkpoint](language/rust/examples/checkpoint) | This example uses published crates.io `praxo-core@0.6.0` to keep checkpoint storage application-owned while using the SDK allowlist for payload encoding. |
| [event-sink](language/rust/examples/event-sink) | This example uses published crates.io `praxo-core@0.6.0` to observe agent lifecycle and tool events without coupling the agent to a logging or telemetry backend. |
| [identity-policy](language/rust/examples/identity-policy) | This example uses published crates.io `praxo-core@0.6.0` to bind a trusted principal to Core policy authorization. The application owns authentication and principal storage; Cor... |
| [mcp](language/rust/examples/mcp) | This example uses published crates.io `praxo-core@0.6.0` with an in-process `McpHttpTransport`. It needs no server process and no network endpoint. |
| [provider-fallback](language/rust/examples/provider-fallback) | This example uses published crates.io `praxo-core@0.6.0` to fall back to a second model when the primary model call fails. |
| [retry](language/rust/examples/retry) | This example uses published crates.io `praxo-core@0.6.0` to retry transient model failures without changing the agent loop. |
| [service](language/rust/examples/service) | This example embeds published crates.io `praxo-core@0.6.0` in a standard-library TCP/HTTP service. The application supplies a principal and tenant, restricts tools, and returns... |
| [streaming](language/rust/examples/streaming) | This example uses published crates.io `praxo-core@0.6.0` to consume deltas while the agent loop keeps running normally. |
| [structured-output](language/rust/examples/structured-output) | This example uses published crates.io `praxo-core@0.6.0` to validate the final answer against a JSON Schema. |

## Verify

Run the checks from `language/rust`:

```bash
cd language/rust
cargo test
cargo run --quiet --bin conformance
python api-snapshot.py --check
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v
```

This mirror contains the language source and the shared `spec/` vectors, so the implementation can be built and tested here. See [`language/rust/README.md`](language/rust/README.md) for the exact commands. The monorepo CI runs conformance, API snapshot, and native tests for this implementation.
